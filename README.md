# Retrieval Augmentation Generation Synthesizer

A cost-free Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that lets you upload multiple technical PDFs and 
generate cross-document insights using open-source models.
It uses **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Hugging Face** models to provide accurate, structured answers ‚Äî entirely without paid APIs.

## ‚ú® Features

-  **Multi-PDF ingestion**: Upload multiple research papers or reports.  
-  **Semantic chunking**: Splits and indexes text using Sentence Transformers.  
-  **FAISS vector search**: Fast, local retrieval of relevant document passages.  
-  **Open-source LLMs**: Uses Hugging Face-hosted or local models (Mistral, Llama, TinyLlama, etc.).  
-  **LangChain-powered RAG**: Combine retrieval and generation in one step.  
-  **Streamlit UI with Plotly**: Simple, interactive visualization of sources and document contributions.  
-  **No API costs or cloud lock-in**: Everything runs locally.
